# Using-Regular-Patterns-to-Find-Pattern-Using-Python
A Python project where I built a simple IP-address screening system to identify potential security risks. Using iteration and conditional logic, the script loops through a list of valid IP addresses, checks each one against a flagged-addresses list, and prints whether it requires further analysis.

It’s a great example of how even basic Python control flow can support real cybersecurity workflows — from monitoring network activity to automating early threat detection. Small steps, big impact.
